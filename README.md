## About 

Implementation of some libc `math.h` functions with at least 1e-6 precision.

## Goal & requirements 

The goal of this project has to understand how the main mathematical functions are implemented in computer using C language. In the course of the work, it was necessary to study and analyze various methods to achieve desired accuracy. One of these methods was Taylor series.

## Key learnings

- Some interesting math algos (Newton method, Taylor series, etc.)
- Working with floats (precision, role of EPS, etc.)
- Trigonometry, their optimization formulas
- Taylor series

## Overview of implemented "math.h" functions

| No. | Function | Description | Status |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1 | `int abs(int x)` | computes absolute value of an integer value | 
| 2 | `long double acos(double x)` | computes arc cosine | ‚úîÔ∏è 
| 3 | `long double asin(double x)` | computes arc sine | ‚úîÔ∏è 
| 4 | `long double atan(double x)` | computes arc tangent | ‚úîÔ∏è 
| 5 | `long double ceil(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not less than the given value |
| 6 | `long double cos(double x)` | computes cosine | ‚úîÔ∏è 
| 7 | `long double exp(double x)` | returns e raised to the given power |
| 8 | `long double fabs(double x)` | computes absolute value of a floating-point value |
| 9 | `long double floor(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not greater than the given value |
| 10 | `long double fmod(double x, double y)` | remainder of the floating-point division operation |
| 11 | `long double log(double x)` | computes natural logarithm |
| 12 | `long double pow(double base, double exp)` | raises a number to the given power |
| 13 | `long double sin(double x)` | computes sine | ‚úîÔ∏è 
| 14 | `long double sqrt(double x)` | computes square root |
| 15 | `long double tan(double x)` | computes tangent | ‚úîÔ∏è 

## Building

1. Clone this repository via
    - SSH `git@github.com:rynortheast/S21_math.git` or
    - HTTPS `https://github.com/rynortheast/S21_math.git`
2. Change code base if necessary
3. Run `make test` to build project and run tests
3. Run `make s21_math` to build a static lib
